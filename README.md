# Prerequisites
* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Streamlit
  

# Data Preprocessing
**The data preprocessing step involves:**

* Loading the customer dataset
* Cleaning the data
* Feature engineering
* Scaling the data
  
# KMeans Clustering

KMeans clustering algorithm is used to segment the customers into different groups based on their features. The algorithm is run with different values of k to select the optimal number of clusters.

# Evaluation and Visualization
**The evaluation step involves:
**
* Calculating the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for each value of k
* Selecting the optimal number of clusters based on the WCSS plot
